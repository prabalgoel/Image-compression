# Image-compression
CS reconstruction algorithms try to find out the sparse estimation of the original
input signal, from compressive measurements, in some suitable basis or frame or
dictionary. The CS reconstruction algorithms are mainly classified under six
approaches [1,6]â€“

A. CONVEX OPTIMIZATION APPROACH

B. GREEDY APPROACH

C. THRESHOLDING APPROACH

D. COMBINATORIAL APPROACH

E. NON-CONVEX APPROACH

F. BAYESIAN APPROACH

We use Thresholding approach in this project, the reason behind being they are
less complex (thus are faster and require less computational power) and can be
implemented effectively over problems of larger size e.g. images[1]. Also, they
provide better results than some of the approaches.
